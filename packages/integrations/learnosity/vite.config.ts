/**
 * Shared build for L0179's Learnosity custom question type.
 *
 * Learnosity fetches `question.js` and `scorer.js` by URL and expects each to call
 * `LearnosityAmd.define` as it loads, so both are self-executing IIFE bundles with React and
 * the renderer bundled in — nothing is external. IIFE takes a single entry, which is why
 * there are two configs (question / scorer) rather than one multi-entry build, mirroring
 * packages/view's vite.config.ts / vite.embed.config.ts split.
 *
 * Output lands in dist/, which the root `assemble` step copies into packages/api/static/ so
 * the language server serves it at the URLs L0176's buildCustom synthesizes:
 *   https://l0179.graffiticode.org/{question.js,scorer.js,question.css}
