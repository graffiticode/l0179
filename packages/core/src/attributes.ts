 * The attribute vocabulary, as data.
 *
 * Most words here are arity 1: one value in, a single-key record out, which the enclosing
 * container merges. A word marked `chaining` is arity 2 instead — see `AttributeMeta.chaining`.
 * Either way, adding an attribute is a row in this file: the lexicon entry, the Checker method
 * and the Transformer method are all generated from it, arity included, so a word can never be
 * arity 1 in one place and arity 2 in another. Never hand-write a handler. See
 * console/docs/language-authoring-style.md.
 *
 * `field` and `coerce` are transcribed from L0166's per-word transformers, not inferred. They
 * are not uniform and the differences are load-bearing for byte-identical output:
 *   - most style attributes emit a KEBAB key (`'background-color'`), not the camelCase name;
 *   - `hide-formulabar` emits `hideMenu`, the one word whose field is unrelated to its spelling;
 *   - most style attributes coerce through `tagValue(v) || ''`, so a bare tag and a quoted
 *     string are the same thing and an absent value becomes "" rather than undefined;
 *   - `align` coerces WITHOUT the `|| ''` fallback, and `method` lowercases.
 * A uniform pass-through table would have silently changed all of that.
