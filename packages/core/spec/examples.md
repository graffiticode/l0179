# L0179 RAG Training Examples

115 example prompts for training a RAG model on L0179, the interactive-spreadsheet language —
covering display spreadsheets, assessed spreadsheets, and parameterized templates.

Each numbered line is a prompt in the author's own voice. Prompts describe WHAT to build, never
how to write it, so this list is inherited from L0166 unchanged: L0179 differs only in source
syntax and compiles to the same form, so every prompt here means the same thing in both
languages. Where the two diverge in future, this file diverges with them.
