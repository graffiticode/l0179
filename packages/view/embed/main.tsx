// The embeddable /form bundle for L0179: mounts the shared View (inherited from
// @graffiticode/l0000-view) with L0179's Form and its spreadsheet reducer cases. Also serves
// as the dev harness.
//
// `formModel="loaded"` because L0166's spreadsheet Form is UNCONTROLLED: its TableEditor seeds
// a ProseMirror document from `interaction.cells` and rebuilds the whole thing — caret back to
// A1 — whenever that object's identity changes. Handing it back the edit it just reported
// re-seeds it on every cell commit, which is the visible flash. The live model still carries
// every edit to the host and the compiler; only what the Form RENDERS from is held to the last
// external load. L0166 gets this for free by keeping state outside React; see view.tsx.
