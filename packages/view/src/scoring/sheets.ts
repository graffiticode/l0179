 * WHY A FLAT KEY SPACE RATHER THAN A NESTED SHAPE. The Learnosity lifecycle lives in
 * `@graffiticode/learnosity-cqt`, a published package shared with every other cell-scored
 * Graffiticode language, and it is flat-keyed in three places that cannot be changed from here:
 *
 *   - `mergeResponse` folds a response back in with `interaction.cells[cellName] = ...`;
 *   - the `response` reducer persists `{...interaction.cells, ...args.cells}`;
 *   - `Scorer.score()` sums `scoredCells[key].score.points` over one flat map.
 *
 * Two sheets both holding `A1` would collide at all three and mis-score silently. Qualifying the
 * KEY instead of nesting the SHAPE keeps every one of them working untouched, and matches the
 * convention a spreadsheet already uses for a cell on another sheet.
 *
 * A program with one sheet keeps bare `A1` keys, exactly as before — so every response already
 * stored against an existing item still reads correctly.

 * what the grid renders from. A multi-sheet grid renders from `interaction.sheets[i].cells`,
 * which the fold never touches, so without this overlay a learner reopens a two-sheet item and
 * finds every answer they saved gone from the screen while it is still in the response.
 *
