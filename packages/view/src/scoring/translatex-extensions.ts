 * separate rule sets. Four edits that had to agree, which is how L0166 and
 * L0179 ended up shipping rule sets whose entire difference was the word
 * `power`.
 *
 * translatex 0.25.0 derives all of that from one descriptor. What is left here
 * is POWER itself and `prepareFormula`, which works around a defect in
 * parselatex rather than in translatex and therefore still has to live in a

 * The defect is in parselatex, not translatex: application by juxtaposition is
 * assembled at the LOWEST multiplicative precedence, so every explicit
 * multiplicative operator binds tighter and closes over the bare callee.
 *
 *     =A1/SUM(A1,A2)     the call is lost
 *     =SUM(A1,A2)/A1     the argument list becomes the numerator, and it throws
 *     =SUM(A1,A2)*A1     parses correctly
 *
 * parselatex 1.8.0 fixes this properly, with a real application production —
 * but only for a caller that declares its function names as `{type:'function'}`
 * in env, and translatex 0.25.0 does not. When it does, every case below
 * becomes a test of the parser fix and this function can go.
 *
 * A redundant pair of brackets is the whole workaround: `=A1/(SUM(A1,A2))`
 * evaluates correctly. Every call that is an operand of `*` or `/` is
 * bracketed, rather than only the three of those four positions that are
 * broken — `=SUM(A1,A2)*A1` already parses, and brackets leave it alone. The
 * scan is left to right and bracketing does not skip the bracketed region, so a
 * call nested inside another call is reached on the same pass.
