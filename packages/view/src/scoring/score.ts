 * Scoring, transcribed VERBATIM from L0166's TableEditor.tsx (lines 419-548, 627-692, 829-848).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE, with no React and no ProseMirror anywhere in its import graph:
 * L0166 exports `scoreCells` from the same entry as its Form, and does not declare
 * `sideEffects: false`. So importing the scorer drags in React and the whole spreadsheet — about
 * 500 kB of dead weight in L0179's Learnosity scorer bundle, and the reason L0166's own deployed
 * scorer cannot be loaded in bare Node: it touches `document` at import time. Learnosity runs the
 * scorer SERVER-side as well as in the browser, so that is not a size complaint, it is a
 * correctness one. Keep this file free of the DOM.
 *
 * Transcribed rather than rewritten, the same rule that governs core's validation.ts and
 * params.ts. Two quirks are carried over deliberately and are NOT to be tidied without a
 * behaviour change of their own:
 *   - `getRegionValidations` returns only the FIRST region (its own TODO says so), so a program
 *     with several row regions scores only one of them today;
 *   - `equivValue` compares stringified values, so `val` and `expected` must already have been
 *     normalized by the caller — which is what the `method === "value"` branch of `scoreCell`
 *     spends most of its length doing.
 *
 * `scoreCells` takes the learner's RESPONSE map, not `interaction.cells`. `interactionCells` is
 * the authored grid, passed through so an `expected` written as a formula can be evaluated
 * against it.
