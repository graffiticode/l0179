/**
 * The dependency graph, built once and kept.
 *
 * Until now there was no graph. `detectCycles` re-derived a cell's edges by re-parsing its formula
 * every time it visited it, `getCellDependencies` ran a whole fresh DFS per name, and the reverse
 * edge — who reads THIS cell — did not exist at all: the renderer reconstructed it by hand into a
 * `deps` array on each cell record, with a whole-map spread per dependency
 * (components/form/TableEditor.tsx). That is the shape that made a cold mount evaluate a chained
 * sheet five times over.
 *
 * Three things here are load-bearing, and each is pinned by a test:
 *
 *   - `precedents` keeps FORMULA ORDER. `detectCycles`'s reported `cyclePath` and its partial
 *     `dependencies` set both depend on the DFS visiting a cell's references in the order the
 *     formula names them. Sorting or de-duplicating differently rewrites the `#CYCLE!` message.
 *   - Traversal state is NEVER shared between start cells. Edges are shared — that is the whole
 *     point — but a `colors` map carried across starts would mark a cell BLACK from an earlier
 *     walk and suppress the `dependencies.add` that the next start expects, silently changing
 *     `getCellDependencies`'s output.
 *   - `findCycle` returns the same partial `dependencies` as before when it finds a cycle: the
 *     DFS returns early, so what it collected up to that point is what comes back. That is
 *     observable and is not a defect to tidy.
 *
 * `getSingleCellDependencies` moved here from formula.ts with it, because it IS the edge parser and
 * belongs with the structure it feeds. It stays the ONLY thing that derives an edge list — every
 * traversal below reads stored edges and never re-parses.

/**
 * The cells a formula reads, in the order it reads them, ranges expanded and duplicates dropped.
 * A non-formula depends on nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS PARSED DIRECTLY rather than rendered through TransLaTeX, which is what it used to do:
 * the `cellNameRules` rule set is meant to re-emit a formula as nothing but its cell names, and for
 * bare arithmetic it does. For a FUNCTION CALL it has a `fn(cellRange)` case inside its `"=?"`
 * dispatch but no top-level rule for function application, so the expression fell through to the
 * generic `"??": "%1%2"` concatenation and the function's name was glued onto the first cell name:
 *
 *     =SUM(A1:A3)    ->  ["SUMA1", "A2", "A3"]     A1 lost
 *     =ROUND(A1,2)   ->  ["ROUNDA1"]               nothing tracked
 *     =IF(A1,B1,C1)  ->  ["IFA1"]                  B1 and C1 lost
 *
 * That was not cosmetic. This list is the reverse edge that drives recalculation, so a cell reading
 * A1 through a function call was never woken when A1 changed: a learner edited an input and the
 * total below it silently kept a stale value, which in an assessed sheet is the value that gets
 * graded. Confirmed in the browser before the fix — `=ROUND(B1,2)` never updated at all, and
 * `=SUM(B1:B3)` updated only when some OTHER cell in the range was touched.
 *
 * Parsing the references directly is both correct and simpler than teaching the rule set about
 * every call shape. The old code also returned the raw formula STRING when the translator threw,
 * which callers then iterated character by character; this always returns an array.
