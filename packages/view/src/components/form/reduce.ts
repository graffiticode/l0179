 * protocol. All of that protocol is generic except one case: an `update` carrying `cells`.
 * L0166's Form reports an edited cell as `{cells: {A1: {text, formattedValue}}}` and expects
 * it merged into `data.interaction.cells`, per cell, PRESERVING each cell's other properties
 * (its `assess` rules, its formatting).
 *
 * The shared View's generic `update` merges onto the top level instead, which writes a `cells`
 * key nothing renders and leaves `interaction.cells` untouched — the edit never reaches the
 * grid, and the next compile response redraws the sheet from source, erasing what was typed.
 * Transcribed from L0166's own reducer so the two agree.
 *
 * Everything else — `init`, `compiled`, `response`, `focus` — is returned as `undefined` so
 * the shared View handles it.
