 * The performance gate.
 *
 * This file counts TransLaTeX `translate()` invocations. That is the whole instrument, and the
 * choice is deliberate: one formula evaluation costs 3-17 ms depending on how many cells are
 * handed to the parser as `env`, while a literal cell costs ~0 ms and every other engine
 * operation (dependency extraction, formatting, colour, borders) is under 0.05 ms. So the cost of
 * this system IS the number of times a formula is parsed, and a count is the only measure of it
 * that does not flake on a loaded CI box.
 *
 * There are exactly four call sites in the codebase — `sheet/formula.ts` (evalCell,
 * formatCellValue) and `scoring/score.ts` (normalizeValue, evaluateExpectedFormula) — and they
 * are reached through one factory, so wrapping the factory catches all four with no
 * instrumentation hook in production code.
 *
 * `buildTranslator` itself is NOT counted, because it is free: it returns a closure and does no
 * parsing. Counting it would suggest caching the translator, which measures as worth nothing.
 *
 * WHEN A COUNT CHANGES, that is the finding. Update the number in the same commit that earns it
 * and say why in the message; never relax an assertion to make a suite green.
